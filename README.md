Cross course project at Noroff. 

### Description
GameHub is a page created as a school project at Noroff. It is a eCommerce designed to sell new and used video games. The project is constantly updated throughout my school projects. It is a good way to see how my FED skills develop through the year. 

GameHub is a website and consists of several pages; most importantly: 
- Home
- Listpage (List of games for sale)
- Product page
- About
- Contact 

The products and all information is fetched from a wordpress API hosted on one.com. 

The GameHub page and URL is hosted on Netlify.
