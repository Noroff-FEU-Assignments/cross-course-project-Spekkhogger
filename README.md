### Description
GameHub is a page created as a school project at Noroff. It is a eCommerce designed to sell new and used video games. The project is constantly updated throughout my school projects. It is a good way to see how my FED skills develop through the year. 

GameHub is a website and consists of several pages; most importantly: 
- Home
